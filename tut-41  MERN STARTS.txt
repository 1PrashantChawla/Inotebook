TUT42.
FRONTEND          			  | 				BACKEND
1.Seperate node modules for both

MONGODB IS used here because it is very easy and we can use JS objects here					
In this course we installed Mongodb on our computer Bcoz we will be using our computer for depkoyment

if we would have deployed on the server then we would have installed in on our server

Backend ke ke lie express package install karenge

ABOUT OUR APP-
I notebook is a cloud app where we can take notes which will be shown only to us.

We created a seperate foldder for Backend 
 STep1; npm init
 STep2:npm i express
 STep3:npm i mongoose // abstraction layer to connect with mongodb

in backend we used THUNDERCLIENT:Thunder Client is an alternative to the famous Postman tool used for testing client APIs..

-----------------MONGODB ------------------------
we can also use the db available on the mongo db atlas which provides a string url. for now we will use mondoDbcompass since we have to use only in coputer

TUT43-
installed MongoDb communty server then it will also install mongo db compass then connect by 

JS has asyncronous nature ,JS works on non blocking nature means whatseber is blocking in the way it will solve the next one rather than getting stuck on it
